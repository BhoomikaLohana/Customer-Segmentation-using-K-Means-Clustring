## Customer Segmentation for Marketing Analysis

# Overview
This project is focused on performing customer segmentation for marketing analysis using machine learning techniques. 
The objective is to analyze customer data and identify distinct segments, which can help businesses tailor marketing strategies to different customer groups.

The project utilizes a real-world dataset that contains various customer attributes such as age, income, spending score, and preferred categories of purchase. By applying clustering algorithms like K-Means, the data is segmented into distinct customer groups.

# Project Components

# 1. Data Collection and Exploration
Load and explore the dataset.
Understand the structure of the data, check for missing values, and visualize the distributions of various features (numerical and categorical).
Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get insights into the dataset's features and relationships.

# 2. Data Preprocessing
Standardize numerical features to ensure they are on the same scale.
Convert categorical features into numerical features using one-hot encoding.
Prepare the data for clustering by applying necessary transformations.

# 3. Clustering Model Building
Apply K-Means clustering to segment the customers.
Use methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualize the clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

# 4. Customer Segmentation
Create customer segments based on the clustering results.
Identify the characteristics of each segment.
Analyze the segments to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.

# Technologies Used
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms (KMeans clustering, StandardScaler, PCA).

## Results and Analysis
After running the clustering algorithm, the customers were segmented into 3 clusters. The segments represent different types of customer behaviors, including their spending patterns, frequency of purchases, and preferred categories.

You can visualize the clustering results using the PCA components in the scatter plot, where different colors represent distinct customer segments.
# Interpretting each Segment
SEGMENT 1:

Average Age: 30 years
Average Income: 90,800
Gender: Male
Low spending Score: 43
Purchase Frequency: 34
Most Preferred Category: Home and Garden
SEGMENT 2:

Average Age: 47
Average Income: 97625
Gender: Female
High spending Score: 55
Purchase Frequency: 17
Most Preferred Category: Groceries
SEGMENT 3:

Average Age: 52
Average Income: 77892
Gender: Other
Moderate spending Score: 53
Purchase Frequency: 27
Most Preferred Category: Home and Garden, Electronics

## Key Insights
Segment 1: High-income customers with frequent purchases, prefer electronics and home & garden products.
Segment 2: Moderate-income customers with average spending, prefer sports and groceries.
Segment 3: Budget-conscious customers with low to moderate spending, prefer clothing and home & garden items.

# Future Work
Test the segmentation model with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
Implement additional marketing strategies based on the identified segments.
Use more advanced techniques like deep learning for customer behavior prediction.
